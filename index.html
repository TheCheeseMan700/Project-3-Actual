        <p>Hello! This is Tim, le artist, not Mr. Helpy. I made this piece because ive loved the world of dnd for the longest time. It helped me get through the quarantine and has overall made me feel like a better and more creative person. I want to be a story teller as I grow older, whether through art or books or games, I've always wanted to share my ideas with the world, so I figured why not start now? This project is based on a dnd world I have been slowly creating in my free time for my friends, but I've fallen more in love with my ideas the longer I workshoped it. All of the data in this project is real data or places or names from my world, maybe not in the order they appear, but they are there.</p>
