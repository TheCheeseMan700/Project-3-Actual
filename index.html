        <h1>Well Howdy there user! I am Mr. Helpy, AI assistant to the Razyathian Entity ID Database, and I am here to help you learn the basics of operating this advanced software! First and foremost, you have you there two power buttons, to turn the system on and off as you need, providing you with a blank slate. After that, the rest is easy peasy lemon squeasy! Your territory buttons on the left side select what location of the Razyatian continent you are looking at at the moment. Then, all you need to do is hit that find ID button and see what entities are out there to find! On the right you'll see a few buttons like 'Register New ID' and such. These buttons are for letting you register new entities that need to be added, with the Exit Register Mode button waiting there to take you back to the normal brower. Last but not least, you can save any ID you are lookin at with the Save Current ID button, ain't that neat? Well thats all I have, enjoy your time here. Happy browsing!</h1>

        <p>Hello! This is Tim, le artist, not Mr. Helpy. This character creator has really meant a lot to me over the past few weeks that I’ve been working on it, as if it was the culmination of all of my work this year not only in Creative Code, but in all of my art classes as a whole. I decided to go with a Dungeons and Dragons style character creator because it's something I know well and have invested time into, using the base system to create a fantasy world that I hope to one day share with the world. Building this creator for project 2 had a lot of mishaps and slightly rushed features, making it not exactly lore accurate to the work it is based on, but by continuing from where I left of there and using it as a base for this project, I was able to correct a lot of those discrepancies, making the creator more faithful to the world I made. I struggled a lot with this project in just getting it to look how I wanted, getting stuck in loops of doing meaningless things that only really slowed me down, but I did in the end manage to get my work to a place I am proud of, even if a few small things still look a little off to me. Overall, I am really happy with this character creator. I'm really happy with everything I learned, and I’m really happy with how class went overall this year. I had an outstanding time, and I cannot wait to use these skills I learned more in the future.</p>
